# Shading Language Template Library

Shading Language Template Library, henceforth referred to as sltl, is an embedded DSL for writing shaders in C++

## Getting Started

To build sltl open the Visual Studio solution file located at the root of the repository. Visual Studio 2015 is currently the only supported develpment environment.

### Prerequisites

There are no external dependencies and therefore no prerequisites.

## Versioning

The library is currently at a proof of concept stage. Once it is possible to write a minimally useful vertex and fragment shader an initial version number will be assigned.

## Contributing

This project is a demonstration of the author's coding skills. There is currently no intention to accept code contributions from other developers although feedback, suggestions for improvements and bug reports are all welcome.

## Licence

TBD. Expected to be open sourced using either boost or MIT licences.
